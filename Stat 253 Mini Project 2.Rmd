## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
buzzfeed <- readr::read_csv("C:/Users/karya/Downloads/buzzfeed.csv")
names(buzzfeed) <- c("title", "text", "url","authors","source","type" )
head(buzzfeed)

```
```{r}
library(tidytext)
tidy_buzzfeed <- buzzfeed %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

buzzfeed_sentiment <- tidy_buzzfeed %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) 
```
